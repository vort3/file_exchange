One user needs trnasmitter py, second one needs receiver.py, public ip and forwarded port in case he is behind router.

How to use this trash?
1. Guy with public IP tells his IP to second guy and starts receiver.py . 
2. Second guy writes this IP to transmitter.py and starts it.
3. Profit.

ToDoLiSt:
- Add GUI for typing IP.
- Merge into single script.
- Add GUI option to choose if user wants to receive or transmit files.
